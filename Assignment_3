**2.1)** short, int, long, and long long all represent integer values of various ranges, with each one greater than the last.
     An unsigned data type represents values greater than or equal to 0.
     A signned data type represents values less than or equal to 0.
     Both float and double are used for more precise computations where its often represented by a decimal value, the difference being 
     that double is twice as precise as float.

**2.2)** Rearding a mortgage payment:
     Rate - int or float since this is usually represented by a value divided by 100.
     Principal -  int since this value can't be negative
     Payment - double since this value requires precision.

**2.3)** 32
     65504
     32
     -32
     0
     0

**2.10)** global_str and global_int are initialized as empty strings and 0 and local_str is considered an empty string.

**2.12)** A,C and D are all invalid

**2.13)** j = 100

**2.14)** It is legal since i is declared before the actual for loop and it prints 100 45

**2.17)** 10 10

**2.27)** B is valid since the initialization of a constant pointer cannot change value.
      C is valid because both values presented are constant
      D is valid because a constant pointer is initialized
      E is valid since pointer p1 is initialized to a constant integer
      G is valid since it presents initialized constants

**2.28)** A is illegal because the contant pointer cp isn't initialized
      B is illegal p2 isn't initialized
      C is legal since ic is initialized
      D is illegal since p3 isn't initialized
      E is legal since the pointer is assigned to a constant integer
