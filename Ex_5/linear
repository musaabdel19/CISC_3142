This program creates a Linear Regression model
based on a separate excel/csv file
(Will be done in pseudo code due to time constraints)

import all necessary libraries
(iostream, vector, fstream etc.)

main function {
     use mentioned libraries to call
     created csv file

     map and store each element of said file

     while loop(start,fin) {
     	   read each line in input file

	   read each element of the line

	   push values back to the line
     }

     create a scatterplot 

     for loop (first point, last point) {
     	 read through each coordinate
	 and plot each point

     }

     calculate the mean of x and y coordinates
     and use the results to display the regression model

     return 0;

}
